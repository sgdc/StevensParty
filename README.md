# StevensParty
Stevens Party is a Stevens/SGDC themed party game. Four players take turns moving around the Stevens campus, collecting Duckbills in order to purchase credits. Purchase items at UCC, Howe, and more in order to get an edge on the competition. Visit academic builds or residence halls to move further on future turns, or travel across campus in a flash in the Stevens Shuttle. After each round, compete head-to-head in a minigame to earn Duckbills. The player with the most credits at the end of the game is the winner!

But we need help making minigames! If you have ever made a game for a game jam (or have a new idea) and want to adapt it into a 4-player minigame, then you are in the right place!

Within the “Minigames” folder, you will find templates (both scenes and scripts) for both single-screen and split-screen minigames, and an example of each (Food Order and Neighborhood Watch). Please reference these templates for learning how to set player icons/sprites, give players scores, and end the game.

When making a minigame, keep it all within 1 folder. Your game folder should then include 3 subfolders: assets, scenes, and scripts.  When you are finished, just send the one main folder to sgdc@stevens.edu.

Have fun making minigames!
